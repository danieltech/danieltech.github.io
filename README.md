Website Performance Optimization portfolio Project.

The optimizations applied to this project were the following:

1. in all .html files i included inline MINIFIED CSS style sheet
2. in all .html files i configured async javascript loading files, 
3. google fonts as inline
4. Use specific media types such as print and media to strategically load other CSS
5. optimization of images size


Particulary for the pizza web file, i also provide:

1. Content Efficiency: minified version of the main.js javascript file (main_minified)
2. Computation Efficiency: i adjusted the code so that the time to resize pizzas is less than 5ms.
3. Gain 60 FPS on Browser Scroll
